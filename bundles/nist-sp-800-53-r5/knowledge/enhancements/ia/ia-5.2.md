# Summary

SP 800-53 control IA-5.2.

# Statement

No statement text was present in the OSCAL record.

# Guidance

Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals, machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via the network.

# Parameters

No parameters were present in the OSCAL record.

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
