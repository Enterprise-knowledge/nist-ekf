# Summary

Protect authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

# Statement

Protect authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

# Guidance

For systems that contain multiple security categories of information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security category of information on the systems. Security categories of information are determined as part of the security categorization process.

# Parameters

No parameters were present in the OSCAL record.

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
