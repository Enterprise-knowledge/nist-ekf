# Summary

SP 800-53 control AC-6.7.

# Statement

No statement text was present in the OSCAL record.

# Guidance

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.
