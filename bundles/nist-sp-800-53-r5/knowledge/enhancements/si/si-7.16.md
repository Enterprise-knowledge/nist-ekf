# Summary

Prohibit processes from executing without supervision for more than {{ insert: param, si-07.16_odp }}.

# Statement

Prohibit processes from executing without supervision for more than {{ insert: param, si-07.16_odp }}.

# Guidance

Placing a time limit on process execution without supervision is intended to apply to processes for which typical or normal execution periods can be determined and situations in which organizations exceed such periods. Supervision includes timers on operating systems, automated responses, and manual oversight and response when system process anomalies occur.

# Parameters

- `si-07.16_odp`

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
