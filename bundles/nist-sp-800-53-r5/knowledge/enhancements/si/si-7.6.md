# Summary

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

# Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

# Guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect integrity include digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information. Organizations that employ cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions.

# Parameters

No parameters were present in the OSCAL record.

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
