# Summary

Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only {{ insert: param, au-09.04_odp }}.

# Statement

Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only {{ insert: param, au-09.04_odp }}.

# Guidance

Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

# Parameters

- `au-09.04_odp`

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
