# Summary

Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.

# Statement

Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.

# Guidance

The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the organization. The organization does not condition its authorization on an expectation of indefinite non-disclosure to the public by the reporting entity but may request a specific time period to properly remediate the vulnerability.

# Parameters

No parameters were present in the OSCAL record.

# Source Notes

This concept was generated from NIST OSCAL structured content and cites the local SP 800-53 PDF as the publication source.
